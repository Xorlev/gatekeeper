# Gatekeeper: NGINX co-process for SOA-style infrastructures

Gatekeeper turns NGINX into your edge service. Gatekeeper watches your [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) service
discovery paths and dynamically builds NGINX upstreams for them. Load balancers (ELBs especially) can be SPOFs and are
the first steps to madness. Cut out the middle man and let NGINX manage your upstream load balancing. 

Gatekeeper uses [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io) templates to build upstreams and locations using your
existing `nginx.conf`.

    events {
        worker_connections  4096;
    }

    http {
        {{#clusters}}
            upstream {{clusterName}} {
            {{#servers}}
                server {{host}}:{{port}};
            {{/servers}}
                keepalive 24;
            }
        {{/clusters}}
        server {
            port 80;

            {{#locations}}
                location {{context}} {
                {{#upstream}}
                    proxy_pass              {{protocol}}://{{clusterName}};
                {{/upstream}}
                {{#attributes}}
                    {{key}}                 {{value}}
                {{/attributes}}
                }
            {{/locations}}
        }
    }
    
With two small blocks of customizable templating, each time a node is registered or deregistered a new `nginx.conf`
is written and NGINX sent a `SIGHUP`.

## Configuration
You'll need a NGINX config template and a `gatekeeper.properties`. There are defaults included in `nginx.conf.mustache.default`
and `gatekeeper.properties.default`.

**Important:** Configuration changes are automatically reloaded. This may change in the future to require a SIGHUP.

Any additional configuration (e.g. FQDN, SSL, listeners, etc.) can be done in nginx.conf as you'd normally
do. You can even include a default upstream and default context directly in the template.

Your `gatekeeper.properties` and `nginx.conf.mustache` should be managed by a configuration management platform, e.g. Chef/Ansible/Puppet.

### Clusters & Routing
In your `gatekeeper.properties` you'll need to define clusters, which will become your NGINX upstreams. These clusters
correspond to cluster names you've defined using your service discovery extension.

The namespace is by default null, e.g. the root path. I use `/discovery`, which ensures that Curator can't accidentally have any namespace collisions with other services.

Discovery Path is the znode under which all of your services then make a znode for themselves.

    /discovery (namespace)
            /services (discoveryPath)
                    /service-a (cluster)
                          instance-1
                          instance-2
                    /service-b
                          instance-1
                          instance-2
                          instance-3

Config for the above looks like this:

    zookeeper.quorum=zookeeper1.mycompany.com
    zookeeper.namespace=discovery
    zookeeper.discoveryPath=/services

    # Upstreams to look for
    clusters=service-a,service-b

Each cluster can then be assigned various contexts for routing. Future work will push this config into ZooKeeper.

    # Proxy_pass locations, comma-separated lists
    cluster.service-a.context=/a
    cluster.service-b.context=/,/b


## Running

Build the agent as you would normally

    mvn package

A jar will be built in `gatekeeper-agent/target/gatekeeper-agent-1.0.1.jar`. Take this jar and put it on your NGINX servers.

You can run the agent as below:

    java -jar gatekeeper.jar -c /path/to/gatekeeper.properties

    or for the default `gatekeeper.properties`

    java -jar gatekeeper.jar

### SupervisorD

I prefer to run Gatekeeper under [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/). A config for Gatekeeper looks like this:

    [program:gatekeeper]
    directory=/opt/gatekeeper
    command=java -Xmx128m -Xss256k -jar gatekeeper-agent.jar -c gatekeeper.properties
    redirect_stderr=true
    stdout_logfile=/var/log/gatekeeper.log
    
### Config management

It's also quite helpful to have centralized configuration management. Changes to the NGINX template can be made via Chef cookbook, or Ansible Playbook. Gatekeeper does not come with any configuration management utilities.

### Forcing a rewrite

Send a SIGHUP to the Gatekeeper process.

    kill -HUP <pid of gatekeeper process>

You should see a message in the log.

## Maven
You'll generally want to compile this yourself, but core is available on Clojars for extension building:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.xorlev.gatekeeper</groupId>
        <artifactId>gatekeeper-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

## Service Discovery Implementations

Currently only supports Netflix Curator Service Discovery Extensions. Other implementations are trivial and can be
 implemented by including `gatekeeper-core`, and including your dependency in the resulting gatekeeper-agent build.
 
You can build gatekeeper with a different module like so:

    mvn package -discovery.package=gatekeeper-some-discovery-module

## FAQ

### Why Java?
I'm not good at C, I believe I'd make a leaky C-module. I am confident in my ability to write a stable Java co-process.
Additionally, Netflix's Curator library is also top-notch, better than any stock Zookeeper library around.
